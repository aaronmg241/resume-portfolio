                Hey! I'm Aaron. I recently graduated from the University of Guelph in April 2022, with a Honor's Degree in Computer Science and a minor in
                Mathematics. I started learning React/Javascript, HTML, and CSS during my last semester, about a year ago, when I started developing the BTRHire
                web applications.

                During school, I never really found a passion for programming. Some assignments were interesting, such as building a bot to play tic-tac-toe
                against, but it never lead to programming outside of school. The problem solving component of Computer Science was always what most intrigued
                me, but I mostly satisfied this intrigue with math problems or (later on) research. It was only when I started on the BTR projects that I
                discovered a passion for the more Software Development side of Computer Science. I realized that I thoroughly enjoyed coming up with a data
                schema, designing an efficient and good looking UI, and developing with more freedom. This is when I thought, "Hey, maybe I really do enjoy
                programming after all."
            </p>

            <p>
                Once I finished school and had more free time, I feel that my learning really picked up. I started developing some personal projects and really
                got deep into the BTR projects. I continue to work with BTR and develop those projects part time. I also started to design small websites, such
                as the one for Grindstone Recruiting. You can see most of my projects on the main page of this website. I have yet to finish some and always
                have side projects on my mind!
            </p>

                Outside of programming, I have a passion for a variety of things that keep me active and keep me entertained while doing it. Currently, that
                seems to be running, but in the past it has been rock climbing, hiking, and basketball at various times. I also love video games, and plan to
                play around with learning some game development in the future.
